## Core Philosophy

```
1. Document
2. Iterate
3. Automate
```

---

## Overview

This file serves as the foundational guide for all workflows generated within the ♾️ WeOwnNet 🌐 workspace. All AI agents, team members, and automated processes should reference and adhere to these practices.

---

## The Three Pillars

### 1. 📝 Document

- **Write it down first** - No task exists until documented
- **Single source of truth** - Use [wiki.3win.social](https://wiki.3win.social) for all workflows
- **Version control** - Track changes with semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Context matters** - Include the "why" not just the "what"

### 2. 🔄 Iterate

- **Start simple** - MVP first, enhancements later
- **Small steps** - Break complex tasks into manageable chunks
- **Feedback loops** - Verify each step before proceeding
- **Continuous improvement** - Refine workflows based on real-world usage

### 3. 🤖 Automate

- **Reduce manual work** - If you do it twice, automate it
- **Standardize first** - Document the process before automating
- **Human-in-the-loop** - Critical decisions require approval
- **Monitor & maintain** - Automation requires ongoing oversight

## People 1st Approach

> **We lead with people, not technology.**

At ♾️ WeOwnNet 🌐, we believe technology should serve humans—not the other way around. Our **AI Coach** role embodies this philosophy:

### 🧑‍🏫 AI Coach

**Your human guide with AI assistance.**

The AI Coach represents our commitment to **human-centered AI**—combining the empathy, wisdom, and judgment of human coaches with the precision, availability, and scalability of AI tools.

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Human First** | Every interaction prioritizes human needs, growth, and empowerment |
| **AI as Partner** | Technology amplifies human capability—it doesn't replace it |
| **Guided Autonomy** | Users remain in control; AI provides options, not directives |
| **Continuous Support** | Available when needed, adapting to individual learning styles |

---

## ♾️ WeOwnNet 🌐 Version Nomenclature

We use a **Season-Based Semantic Versioning** system that combines business cycles with semantic best practices.

### Format: `SEASON.MONTH.PATCH`

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **SEASON** | #WeOwnSeason number | `2` = #WeOwnSeason002 |
| **MONTH** | Month within the season (1-4) | `4` = January (4th month of Season 002) |
| **PATCH** | Incremental release following [SemVer](https://semver.org/) best practices | `1`, `2`, `3`... |

### Current Season Reference

| Season | Months Covered | Version Prefix |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| #WeOwnSeason001 | Jun / Jul / Aug / Sep 2025 | `1.x.x` |
| #WeOwnSeason002 | Oct / Nov / Dec 2025 / Jan 2026 | `2.x.x` |
| #WeOwnSeason003 | Feb / Mar / Apr / May 2026 | `3.x.x` |

### Month Mapping (Per Season)

| Month Position | #WeOwnSeason002 Example |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| `.1.x` | October 2025 |
| `.2.x` | November 2025 |
| `.3.x` | December 2025 |
| `.4.x` | January 2026 |

### Example Breakdown

**Version `2.4.1`**
- `2` = #WeOwnSeason002 (Oct 2025 – Jan 2026)
- `4` = January (4th month of the season)
- `1` = First release in January

**Next Release:** `2.4.2` (next iteration in January 2026)

## Workflow Tier System

All plugins, tools, and processes follow this priority system:

| Tier | Emoji | Priority | Description |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| CRITICAL | 🆘 | 1st | Install/execute immediately - system won't function without |
| BASE | 🔴 | 2nd | Required for all deployments |
| OPTIONAL | 🟡 | 3rd | Install based on project requirements |
| PREMIUM | 🟠 | 4th | Client-specific / upsell opportunities |
